Attention Mechanisms Module

This module implements the core attention mechanisms used in transformers.

The Attention Revolution:
    Before attention, neural networks processed sequences using RNNs (recurrent neural
    networks), which had fundamental limitations:
    1. Sequential processing - can't parallelize
    2. Vanishing gradients for long sequences
    3. Limited memory of distant tokens

    The attention mechanism solved these by allowing each token to directly look at
    ALL other tokens in the sequence, regardless of distance.

Key Insight - "Attention Is All You Need":
    Instead of processing tokens sequentially, attention computes relationships between
    ALL pairs of tokens simultaneously. This enables:
    - Parallel computation (all tokens processed at once)
    - Direct connections between distant tokens (no vanishing gradient)
    - Flexible, learned patterns of information flow

The Query-Key-Value Paradigm:
    Attention is based on an information retrieval metaphor:
    - Query (Q): "What am I looking for?"
    - Key (K): "What do I contain?"
    - Value (V): "What information do I have?"

    The process:
    1. Each token creates a query: "I need information about X"
    2. All tokens offer keys: "I have information about Y"
    3. Compute similarity: query · key (dot product)
    4. Retrieve information: weighted sum of values based on similarity

Why Three Separate Matrices?
    We could use the same representation for Q, K, V, but separate projections allow:
    - Specialization: queries optimized for searching, keys for matching, values for content
    - Flexibility: model learns different representations for different roles
    - Expressiveness: more parameters = more representational capacity

This module implements:
    1. Scaled Dot-Product Attention: The fundamental attention operation
    2. Multi-Head Attention: Running multiple attention operations in parallel

def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    """
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention - the fundamental attention operation.

    This is the core mechanism that powers transformers. It computes how much
    each position should attend to (focus on) every other position.

    The Formula:
        Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q @ K^T / sqrt(d_k)) @ V

    Breaking It Down:
        1. Q @ K^T: Compute similarity between all query-key pairs
           Shape: (batch, seq_len, d_k) @ (batch, d_k, seq_len) → (batch, seq_len, seq_len)
           Result: attention_scores[i,j] = how much position i attends to position j

        2. / sqrt(d_k): Scale by square root of key dimension
           Why? Without scaling, dot products grow large for high dimensions, pushing
           softmax into regions with tiny gradients (vanishing gradient problem).

           Mathematical intuition:
           - If keys/queries are random with variance 1, their dot product has variance d_k
           - Dividing by sqrt(d_k) normalizes variance back to 1
           - This keeps softmax in its "active" region with good gradients

        3. softmax(...): Convert scores to probabilities
           - Each row sums to 1 (valid probability distribution)
           - Larger scores get higher probabilities (exponential emphasis)
           - Differentiable (enables learning)

        4. @ V: Weighted sum of values
           - Multiply attention probabilities by values
           - Each output is a mixture of all value vectors
           - Weights determined by attention scores

    Why This Works:
        This operation allows each token to collect information from other tokens based
        on learned patterns. For example:
        - In "The cat sat on the mat", "cat" might attend strongly to "sat" (subject-verb)
        - In "Max(3, 7, 5)", the model learns to attend to relevant numbers
        - Patterns are learned from data, not hand-coded

    Comparison to Other Mechanisms:
        - RNN: Only sees previous tokens, sequential computation
        - CNN: Fixed receptive field, limited context
        - Attention: Sees all tokens, parallel computation, learned focus

    Args:
        Q (np.ndarray): Query matrix, shape (batch, seq_len, d_k)
                       "What each position is looking for"
        K (np.ndarray): Key matrix, shape (batch, seq_len, d_k)
                       "What each position offers"
        V (np.ndarray): Value matrix, shape (batch, seq_len, d_v)
                       "The actual information at each position"
        mask (np.ndarray, optional): Attention mask, shape (batch, seq_len, seq_len)
                                    Use to prevent attending to certain positions
                                    (e.g., padding tokens or future tokens in decoder)

    Returns:
        tuple: (output, attention_weights)
            - output: Weighted sum of values, shape (batch, seq_len, d_v)
            - attention_weights: Attention probabilities, shape (batch, seq_len, seq_len)
                               Useful for visualization and interpretability

    Example:
        >>> Q = K = V = np.random.randn(2, 10, 64)  # batch=2, seq_len=10, d_k=64
        >>> output, attn = scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V)
        >>> output.shape  # (2, 10, 64) - same as input
        >>> attn.shape    # (2, 10, 10) - attention matrix
        >>> np.allclose(attn.sum(axis=-1), 1.0)  # True - probabilities sum to 1

    Implementation Notes:
        - We return attention weights for visualization/debugging
        - Masking is additive (add large negative value) rather than multiplicative
        - This is a stateless function (no learnable parameters here)
        - The Q, K, V matrices are created by learned linear projections elsewhere

class MultiHeadAttention:
    """
    Multi-Head Attention - the key innovation that powers transformers.

    Why Multiple Heads?
        Single attention can only learn one pattern of relationships. Multi-head attention
        runs multiple attention operations in parallel, allowing the model to learn
        different types of relationships simultaneously.

    Example Specialization:
        In language models, different heads might learn:
        - Head 1: Subject-verb relationships ("cat" → "sat")
        - Head 2: Adjective-noun relationships ("big" → "cat")
        - Head 3: Long-range dependencies (opening quote → closing quote)

        For our digit operations:
        - Head 1: Might focus on the operation token (Max, Min, etc.)
        - Head 2: Might compare digit values
        - Head 3: Might track positional information (First, Last)
        - Head 4: Might identify the largest/smallest value

    The Multi-Head Process:
        1. Project input into Q, K, V using learned matrices (shared across heads)
        2. Split Q, K, V into multiple heads (reshape)
        3. Apply scaled dot-product attention independently per head
        4. Concatenate head outputs
        5. Project concatenated result with output matrix

    Why Split vs Separate Projections?
        Two approaches for multi-head:
        A) Single large projection, then split (what we do)
        B) Separate projection matrices per head

        We use (A) because:
        - More parameter efficient (one projection vs N projections)
        - Equivalent in representational power
        - Easier to implement and debug
        - Standard in transformer literature

    Dimension Arithmetic:
        - Input: (batch, seq_len, embed_dim)
        - embed_dim = num_heads * head_dim
        - Per-head dimensions: (batch, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)
        - After concat: (batch, seq_len, embed_dim)
        - After output projection: (batch, seq_len, embed_dim)

    Why Same Input/Output Dimension?
        Transformers use residual connections (x + Attention(x)), which require
        matching dimensions. This also allows stacking many layers easily.

    Args:
        embed_dim (int): Dimension of input embeddings (e.g., 64)
        num_heads (int): Number of parallel attention heads (e.g., 4)

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If embed_dim not divisible by num_heads

    Attributes:
        head_dim (int): Dimension per head (embed_dim // num_heads)
        W_q, W_k, W_v (np.ndarray): Query, Key, Value projection matrices
        W_o (np.ndarray): Output projection matrix

    Example:
        >>> mha = MultiHeadAttention(embed_dim=64, num_heads=4)
        >>> x = np.random.randn(2, 10, 64)  # batch=2, seq_len=10
        >>> output, attn = mha.forward(x)
        >>> output.shape  # (2, 10, 64) - same as input

        Initialize Multi-Head Attention.

        Initialization Strategy:
            We use Xavier/Glorot initialization for all projection matrices.
            This maintains activation variance through the layers.

        Why Xavier for Attention?
            Attention involves matrix multiplications (Q@K^T, attn@V), so we need
            initialization that prevents activations from exploding or vanishing.
            Xavier is designed exactly for this purpose.

        Dimension Requirements:
            embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads so we can evenly split.

        Why This Reshape?
            We want to go from processing one large attention to processing multiple

        Why Concatenate?
            Each head has learned different patterns. Concatenating preserves all
            information from all heads, letting the output projection (W_o) decide
            how to mix them.

        1. Gradients flow through multiple matrix multiplications
        2. Reshape/transpose operations require careful index management
        3. Attention mechanism couples all positions together
        4. We need gradients for 4 different weight matrices (Q, K, V, O)

        Gradient Flow:
            grad_output → [W_o gradient] → [Combine heads gradient] →
            [Attention gradient] → [Split heads gradient] → [Q,K,V gradients] → grad_input

        Key Challenges:
            - Transpose/reshape operations reverse in backward pass
            - Attention gradient is complex (flows through softmax and matmuls)
            - Must accumulate gradients for shared parameters (W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o)

        Why This Is Important:
            Understanding this backward pass teaches:
            - How gradients flow through attention mechanisms
            - Matrix calculus for transformer architectures
            - Why transformers can be trained end-to-end
